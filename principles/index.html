	<h1>Principles</h1>
	<p>Two books that deeply impacted me were <a href='http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html'>Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href='https://www.principles.com/'>Principles by Ray Dalio</a>. I thought I should keep track of mine and make sure I live by them.</p>
    <p>1. Play Everyday</p>
	<p>2. Spend more time creating than consuming</p>
	<p>3. Evolve or die.</p>
	<p>4. Dream big and dream often</p>
	<p>5. Strive to punch above your weight</p>
	<h2>Guiding Quotes</h2>
	<p>1. There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains it own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death. ~ Dune (1965)</p>
	<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organizationâ€™s communication structure.- M Conway</p>
