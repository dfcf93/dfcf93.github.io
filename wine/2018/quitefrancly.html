    <p>In 2018 we decided to go all in on Cab Franc and it did not dissapoint. The grapes matured beautifully this year and came in ~27 Brix when we picked! Wine was fermented naturally after 4 days of cold soak. Fermentation on skin went for 5 months and then only the free run was placed into new american oak barrel.</p>
