<div class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a technologist/winemaker/thinker/dad/glad-scientist/dude who lives in Seattle WA.</p>
	<p>I born in Mexico City where I attended <a href='asf.edu.mx'>ASF</a> for like a million years. I went to <a href='rpi.edu'>RPI</a> from 08-2011 to 05-2015 where I got a BS in computer science.</p> 
	<p>Along the way I worked for <a href=''>KIO Networks</a>,<a href='https://www.ge.com/'>GE</a>,<a href='https://www.cisco.com/'>Cisco</a>,<a href='https://www.basistech.com/'>Basis Tech</a> and now I work as a PM for <a href='bing.com'>Bing Relevance</a>.</p>
	<p>I work on Applied Metrics and Research focused on Information Retrieval and Deep Learning and I work on <a href='msmarco.org'>MSMARCO</a> on the side.
	<p>Despite my terrible spelling and grammar I am super interesting in language and thus I am pursuing my Masters in <a href='https://www.compling.uw.edu/'>Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington</a> (Targeting 2020 graduation). I am proudly a Chicano/Latino.</p>
	<p>I have previously worked on Machine Translation, Search and enterprise web services @Microsoft, MultiLingual Named Entity Resolution @Basis Tech, Publishing/Storytelling @Gapelia/Folio, Networking Software @Cisco, Website Design @GE, Data Center servicing @KIO and random shenanigans between.</p>
	<p>Outside of work and schooling I have a beautiful wife, a adorable baby, and a fuzzy cat. Together we make wine, ferment food, and renovate houses.</p>
