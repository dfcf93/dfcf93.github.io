# Random Walk 05-05-2019
## Intro

## Main 
1. Your favorite jazzed up EX-CEO believes we the people of the United States should be able to access data on our nations performance much like one can get for a publicly traded company. As a result he funds/develops [USA Facts](https://usafacts.org/) which just dropped their 2018 report. If you don't get excited by this kind of information the TL;DR is [~Half of Government Spending Supports the Elderly or Disadvantaged](https://annualreport.usafacts.org/articles/46-government-finances-nearly-half-government-spending-supports-elderly-disadvantaged-cash-transfer-subsidy-service-t), [We are more single, have less kids, and live more alone](https://annualreport.usafacts.org/articles/8-population-americans-living-fewer-kids), and [The goverment overspent by ~770b in 2018](https://annualreport.usafacts.org/articles/41-government-finances-government-spending-exceeded-revenue-six-years-1980)
2. I've always felt guilty when consuming something tiny in packaging like ketchup. Luckily a company has been developing an [Edible and biodegradeable alternative to plastic.](https://www.notpla.com/products/) They eve used it at this years London Marathon to give out water and energy gummies. If this expands will eating packets of ketchup and mustard become the mainstays of atheletes everywhere?
3. Ever wanted to stay overnight in a huge potato in Idaho Farm land? Some awesome people have created [Big Idaho Potato Hotel](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32011367?guests=1&adults=1) which comes with awesome extras like cows. Please someone book it and send me photos of your experience.
4. Want to buy your loved one a sick vase but not sure what matches their style [Love Handles Ceramic Vase](https://www.matchesfashion.com/us/products/Anissa-Kermiche-Love-Handles-ceramic-vase-1297178) has you covered.
5. You know when you go to your favorite brewery and you can't choose from the 404143151 IPAs they offer? Someone studdied how humans make ch is near imposible? Turns out someone studied when the amount of choices make us break [Someone studdied how humans make choices](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0440-2) given a bunch of options and after 12 we can't choose very well.
6. I would be proud to serve [Octopus Rum](https://www.behance.net/gallery/78588699/Octopus-Rum) in my bar soley based on how cute the packaging is.
7. Orthagonally to being the messiah of the Startup world, [Paul Graham best advice is on fatherhood.](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-best-advice-Paul-Graham-ever-gave-you-at-Y-Combinator/answer/Andrew-Roberts-4) I hope my son Theo is excited by random things and I hope I can share his excitement.
8. In my one AI related item, the researchers over at OpenAI developed [Musenet](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/) which they believe can capture some of the long term dependencies in music to create enjoyable work. Give it a listen and hear the future. 
9. [Welcome to Shanghai, the capital of the future](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-welcome-to-shanghai-the-capital-of-the-future/) with its 12 metro lines, is now the most extensive in the world, yet its first line opened only in 1993. Shanghai is growing faster than anywhere else and their urbanization just works. I spent a week working there in 2017 and honestly I've been itching to go back ever since. Never have I felt so mobile in a city so large despite not knowing the langauge, anyone, or what I was doing. 

## Will Someone Build This
1. Given the explosion of facial recognition and [hacks that exploit the system fragility](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512472/fool-ai-surveillance-adversarial-example-yolov2-person-detection) it would be very cool to have a clothing line that made you invisible to facial/object recognition. Your newest [Dad Hat](https://www.dadhatlife.com/) makes Google Photos think you are a cat? Sign me up.

## Shower Thoughts([From Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/showerthoughts))
1. If stoners hung out at old age homes, the elderly would get someone to talk to and stoners would get someone mature to have deep philosophical discussions with.
2. We somehow managed to discover Uranus before Antarctica.
3. Metaphorically and literally, if you burn too many bridges people won't trust you to build new ones
4. For every video game there is a guy who made grunting sounds in a recording studio for a day.

## Deeper Thoughts: Rhythm
My son was born 03-23-2019. I thought a lot before he was born on how my life would change and what it meant. Unsurprisingly, after 6 weeks of parenthood what has changed most in my life is not at all what I expected would. Little Theo has mostly changed my rhythm and
