    <p>In 2017 all of our wines were destemmed cold soaked for 4 days. Yeast was pitched and the wines were fermented on skins with stems. Wines were pressed after 4 months on skins. They were racked 3 times but not filtered.</p>
    <p>As with the other 2017 vintages we wanted to explore how the cabernets played together and once we had our 2nd press we had equal amounts of liquids. The next logic step was to blend them. Wine was aged in glass for 12 months with no oak.</p>
