### Intro
Hey,

As I get older I find myself taking more time to think which has lead me to the conclusion I should write more. I have always loved reading and talking but since I have never been a particularly good writter I have avoided it like the plaugue. 
Its mid may and the world is neck deep in coronavirus fear. 


Till next time,
Daniel
