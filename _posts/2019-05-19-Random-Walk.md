# Random Walk 05-19-2019
### Intro
Hey,

Welcome into a random walk through my mind. Every week I will try to contain what I read that made me think or inspired me most. Things range from design, tech, philosophy and cat videos.

### Product Ideas
1. For all those Game of Thrones fans there have been various real world beverages spotted recently, see [Turns out winterfell has a starbucks](https://twitter.com/IWriteAllDay_/status/1125299683004276738). What if there was a chrome plugin that automatically stuck easter eggs in all shows you watched as a way to keep you on your toes?

### Thoughts: Interest
Things become interesting where there is contrasting, unusual information closely tied with traditional information separated with realistic cues. Interesting objects behave according to most natural laws but not all. E.G. cats in clothing, pop art, molecular gastronomy.
