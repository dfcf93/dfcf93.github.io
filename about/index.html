<p>My primary interests lie in the intersection of efficient models, natural language processing and information understanding systems(IR, IE, etc.)</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Mexico City, got a BS in CS at <a href='rpi.edu'>RPI</a>, MS in Computational Linguistics (CS focused NLP) at <a href='http://www.washington.edu/'>UW</a> and have worked at many tech firms along the way.
