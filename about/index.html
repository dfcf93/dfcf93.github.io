<div class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am a technologist and tinkerer currently located in Urbana, Illinois</p>
	<p>I am pursing a PhD in Computer Science at <a href='https://cs.illinois.edu/'>UIUC</a> where I will work under <a href='http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html'>Prof. Heng Ji</a> as part of the <a href='http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/index.html'>Blender Lab.</a></p>
	<p>I am researching how to make NLP and transformer models more efficient with the good folks at <a href='https://neuralmagic.com/'>Neural Magic</a>.</p>
	<p>My primary interests lie in the intersection of efficient models, natural language processing and information understanding systems(IR, IE, etc.)</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in Mexico City attended <a href='asf.edu.mx'>ASF</a></p>
	<p>I have a BS in Computer Science from <a href='rpi.edu'>RPI</a>(2011-2015) and a MS in Computational Linguistics from the <a href='http://www.washington.edu/'>University of Washington</a>(2018-2020).</p> 
	<p>Along the way I worked for <a href='https://www.kionetworks.com/en/'>KIO Networks</a>,<a href='https://www.ge.com/'>GE</a>,<a href='https://www.cisco.com/'>Cisco</a>,<a href='https://www.basistech.com/'>Basis Tech</a>,  and <a href='microsoft.com'>Microsoft</a> where I gradually dug my Computer Science hole deeper.</p>
	<p>Outside of work and schooling I have a beautiful wife (Zoe), an adorable todler (Theo). Together we make wine, ferment food, surf, kiteboard, camp, and renovate houses.</p>
