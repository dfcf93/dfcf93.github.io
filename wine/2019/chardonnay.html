    <p>Inspired by the orange wines we have been seeing everywhere we decided to give it a go. We picked up 100lbs of chardonnay picked at 22 brix and manually destemmed and crushed the grapes. The wine then sat on skins for 6 weeks until it was pressed into a carboy with this beautiful orange hue.</p>
    <p>This is not your mom's chardonnay because its vibrant and full of flavor. An explosion of summer in your mouth!</p>
