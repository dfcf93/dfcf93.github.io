	<h1>Principles</h1>
	<p>Two books that deeply impacted me were <a href='http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html'>Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href='https://www.principles.com/'>Principles by Ray Dalio</a>. I thought I should keep track of mine and make sure I live by them.</p>
    <p>1. Play Everyday</p>
	<p>2. Spend more time creating than consuming</p>
	<p>3. Evolve or die.</p>
	<p>4. Dream big and dream often</p>
	<p>5. Strive to punch above your weight</p>
