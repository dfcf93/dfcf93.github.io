		<p>I am a technologist and tinkerer currently located in Urbana, Illinois</p>

		<p>I am researching how to make NLP and transformer models more efficient with the good folks at <a href='https://neuralmagic.com/'>Neural Magic</a>.</p>
		<p>My primary interests lie in the intersection of efficient models, natural language processing and information understanding systems(IR, IE, etc.)</p>
		<p>I love to get nerdy about wine, computers, the nature of intelligence, and any sport with a board.</p>
