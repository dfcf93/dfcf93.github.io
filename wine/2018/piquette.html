    <h4>Year:2018</h4>
    <h4>Tasting Notes:Roasted Jalapeno, Rasberry, Citrus</h4>
    <h4>Grape Origin:[Eclectic Vineyard](https://www.eclecticvineyards.com)</h4>
    <h4>Varietal: Cabernet Franc</h4>
    <h4>Production:10 Bottles</h4>
    <p>Inspired by [Wild Arc Farm's](https://www.wildarcfarm.com/) Piquette we decided to try our hand at making one with our Cab Franc must.</p>
    <p>The must was rehydrated and fermented for 2 months. After pressing the wine received a 15% addition of the 2018 Cab Franc and was aged with oak chips for 6 months.</p>
    <p>After 2 rackings we bottled and used wild honey for bottle conditioning.</p>
    <p>The low alcohol of this wine and the incredibly interesting character make for a perfect warm weather sparking beverage.</p>
